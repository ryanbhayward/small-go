Efficient implementation of Go with positional superko for solving games
on up to 8x8 boards.

Project status: Not all board positions are solvable yet. The logical next step
to improve  this solver is to add more theorems (positions where we know the 
value unconditionally under positional superko). This may require some tweaks
to the theorem interface.
